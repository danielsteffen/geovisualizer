<p>From March, 10 to 14, the department Augmented Vision will present latest 
research results at the CeBIT 2014 in Hannover including the . Addressing the lead theme 
"Datability is all about the ability to use large volumes of data sustainably 
and responsibly" DFKI's researchers will showcase current trends in wearable 
technologies. Today, wearables - miniaturized, body-worn sensors for measuring 
and monitoring users’ vital signs, activities and behaviors - can be found 
everywhere. In this context the research department Augmented Vision demonstrates 
a software system for monitoring, storing, and visualizing mobile sensor data using the GeoVisualizer application. 
Using a smart phone and sensors being connected via Bluetooth different 
application scenarios will be showcased, ranging from activity recognition 
to emotion detection.</p>
