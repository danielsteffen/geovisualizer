GeoVisualizer Videos

  The following page lists some videos (HTML5) showing the features of the 
GeoVisualizer application. Currently, only Firefox (>10.0) has the possibility 
to switch to <<fullscreen mode>>. However, you should be able to download the 
video and watch it with your favorite media player.
